# govuk-frontend-diff

Command line tool to compare a custom implementation of govuk-frontend templates with the reference Nunjucks

## Installation

### Using the binaries

Binaries for OSX, Linux and Windows are provided. The [latest binaries can be found here](https://github.com/andymantell/govuk-frontend-diff/releases/latest).

Using the binaries does not require NodeJS to be installed.

_If you are have NodeJS available it is more optimal to run the script directly with NodeJS as shown below, since the binaries are quite large (Due to packaging up NodeJS and the required node_modules in the binary)._

### With NodeJS

If you wish, you can install govuk-frontend-diff globally: `npm install -g govuk-frontend-diff` or alternatively you can install it locally to your package and create a script entry in your package.json to run `govuk-frontend-diff` (Since npm automatically resolves paths to `node_modules/bin` scripts when they're run from package.json script entries).

#### Via npx

As with any cli tool published to the npm registry, you can simply run `npx govuk-frontend-diff`.

## Usage

```
Usage: govuk-frontend-diff ./render.sh --govuk-frontend-version=v3.7.0

Commands:
  index.js <script>  Tests the output of the provided render script against the
                     govuk-frontend reference nunjucks.

                     This script must take --component and --params arguments,
                     and return the html for a given component/params combo as
                     rendered html on stdout

Options:
  --help                    Show help                                  [boolean]
  --version                 Show version number                        [boolean]
  --govuk-frontend-version  Version of govuk-frontend to test against.
                            This will normally be references to tags like v3.7.0
                            but this will accept any commit-ish such as branches
                            or even commit identifiers                [required]
  --force-refresh           Force a re-download of govuk-frontend, bypassing the
                            cache. Useful if the version you are specifying
                            represents a branch such as if you were testing
                            against master
```
